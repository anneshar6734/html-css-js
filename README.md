Hands-on learning HTML, CSS and JS.
its exactly as it sounds, hands-on. I am building tiny projects and mini apps to make it a bit easier for someone like me.

Goal: 
- To code without copy-pasting or being stuck in tutorial hell.
                                                    
Personal Comment:
- //I was so scared that I never watched videos on coding. 
- //if I ever use viedeos it would only be to learn approaches or mental models or something like that. 

Problem:
- I do the step-by-step FCC projects, then forget them or never know how it even works.

Solution:
- Approach 1: I originally followed the FCC project concepts break them down, and tried to rebuild each concept as tiny projects and mini apps without looking at any code.
- Approach 2: work in progress.


Rules to keep in mind as a beginner i am:
- Copy-paste code, not allowed
- do not look at the code directly
- Use only Google for learning
- AI to give you direction
