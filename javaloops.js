/*
Print all numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.
Print all even numbers between 1 and 20.
Print all odd numbers between 1 and 20.
Use a while loop to print countdown from 10 to 1.
Print the square of each number from 1 to 5.
🧠 Checkpoint: if you can write them without checking anything, you’ve rebuilt your syntax.

 Level 2
6 Print the sum of numbers 1 → 10 using a loop.
7 Print the product of numbers 1 → 5 (like factorial).
8 Count how many numbers between 1 → 20 are divisible by 3.
9 Make a variable total outside the loop, and inside add each number to it
 — then console.log(total) after the loop.
10 Try the same with a while loop — can you get the same result?
🧠 Checkpoint: notice how placement of variables (inside vs outside loop) changes everything.
